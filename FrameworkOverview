Project Structure Overview

Your code demonstrates a well-structured test automation framework. Here's a breakdown of the key packages and their purposes:

com.bibin.annotation: Contains a custom annotation (TestCaseStatus) used to metadata related to test methods.
com.bibin.context: Houses the TestContext class, acting as a shared data store for your tests.
com.bibin.pages: The core of your page object model. Includes the LoginPage interface and its implementation (LoginPageImpl).
com.bibin.utility: Contains utility classes (PicoHelper, WebDriverFactory, ConfigurationReader) providing configuration and setup logic.
com.bibin.dataaccess / repository: (Presumably) Defines interfaces and classes like DatabaseService and UserRepositoryImpl to deal with data interactions.
Step-by-Step Execution

Here's a simplified walk-through of how a test using this framework might operate:

Configuration:

During setup, ConfigurationReader loads your app.properties configuration file making properties accessible.
PicoHelper registers components within a PicoContainer; the container manages dependencies
Test Execution:

A test wants to utilize LoginPage. It requests LoginPage from the PageObjectManager.
PageObjectManager gets the necessary components (like the WebDriver) from the PicoContainer.
WebDriverFactory handles setting up the correct browser driver type using ThreadLocal to keep drivers safe in multithreaded test suites.
The test interacts with elements or methods defined in the LoginPage interface (enterUsername, enterPassword, etc.).
Data Management

Your tests might need to utilize data.
The TestContext allows you to share data between steps across various classes while tests execute.
The DatabaseService (likely along with repositories) would handle fetching or storing data in a database.
Design Patterns

Your code leverages several key design patterns:

Page Object Model (POM): This is central to your framework. Your com.bibin.pages package encapsulates web page interactions within page classes, promoting maintainability and readability.
Dependency Injection (DI): Using PicoContainer within PicoHelper facilitates DI. Components are loosely coupled, improving testability and flexibility.
ThreadLocal: WebDriverFactory uses ThreadLocal ensuring each test thread maintains its own browser driver instance, a crucial aspect of test isolation.
Singleton (partially): ConfigurationReader provides controlled access to application properties in a manner resembling the Singleton pattern.
Factory The WebDriverFactory acts as a simple factory creating browser driver instances based on provided input.
Interview Considerations

Be ready to discuss these points during your interview:

Why POM? Explain its advantages in testing, like reduced code duplication, and clearer separation of concerns.
DI Benefits: Dependency Injection allows components to be configured and replaced easily, increasing the flexibility of your tests.
Thread Safety: Emphasize the importance of ThreadLocal for parallel test execution, preventing browser conflicts.
Custom Annotation: Explain the purpose of your TestCaseStatus annotation. How does it help structure or report test information
